# Compendium of Stakeholders
### Governance Accountability & Operations Research — Irish & EU Dimensions
*Updated: February 27th, 2026*

---

## Preamble

This compendium maps every party with a cognisable interest in the protracted failure to engage with Operations Research (O.R.) in Irish public governance — a failure documented continuously from the initial submission of November 11th, 2006, through to the present. The matter is no longer bounded by domestic administrative law. As Ireland holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2026, every layer of stakeholder interest — individual, civic, parliamentary, executive, judicial, bilateral, and supranational — is now engaged.

## Judicial Review — Prefatory Legal Question

For the purpose of judicial review and technical accuracy, it is essential to first distinguish between two distinct EU leadership roles: the **Presidency of the Council of the European Union** (a rotating role held by Member State governments) and the **President of the European Council** (a permanent individual position, currently held by António Costa).

**Legal Question for the Court of Justice of the European Union**:

> "Can a Member State lawfully hold the Council Presidency while suppressing an ethics complaint that documents its own breach of Treaty obligations in areas within the Presidency's functional responsibilities?"

No appropriate response has been received —no explanation postulated.

---

## Part I — The Council Presidency: Legal Basis and Structural Context

### I. Legal Basis and Governance

The rotation of the Presidency is governed by **Article 16(9)** of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and **Article 236** of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The current specific order was established by **Council Decision (EU) 2016/1316**, which revised the schedule through December 31st, 2030, following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.

### II. Rotation Schedule (2024–2030)

The Presidency rotates every six months. As of February 27th, 2026, the Presidency is held by **Cyprus**.

| **Year** | **January – June** | **July – December** |
|---|---|---|
| **2024** | Belgium | Hungary |
| **2025** | Poland | Denmark |
| **2026** | **Cyprus** (Current) | **Ireland** (Upcoming) |
| **2027** | Lithuania | Greece |
| **2028** | Italy | Latvia |
| **2029** | Luxembourg | Netherlands |
| **2030** | Slovakia | Malta |

> **Note:** Per Article 3 of Decision 2016/1316, the Council must determine the order for the period beginning January 1st, 2031, no later than December 31st, 2029.

### III. The "Trio" System

To ensure continuity across the six-month terms, Member States work in groups of three, known as **"Trios."** These trios prepare a shared 18-month programme of long-term goals and a common agenda.

- **Current Trio (2025–2026):** Poland, Denmark, and Cyprus.
- **Next Trio (2026–2027):** Ireland, Lithuania, and Greece.

### IV. Functional Responsibilities of the Presidency

The Member State holding the Presidency is responsible for:

1. **Chairing Meetings** — leading sessions of the Council (except the Foreign Affairs Council, which is chaired by the High Representative).
2. **Agenda Setting** — determining the priority of legislative files and brokering compromises between Member States.
3. **Representation** — representing the Council in negotiations with other EU institutions, such as the European Parliament and the Commission (trilogues).

---

## Part II — Structural Entrapment: The Presidency as Accountability Dissolution Mechanism

### A. The Temporal Trap

The convergence of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency with the twenty-year suppression of the O.R. ethics complaint constitutes what the documentation characterises as **structural entrapment** — a condition in which institutional architecture systematically prevents the discharge of accountability obligations.

- Ireland assumes the EU Council Presidency: **July 1st, 2026** (in approximately four months from the date of this document)
- Ethics complaint suppression: **November 11th, 2006 – February 27th, 2026** (twenty years)

**The Nullification Loop in temporal terms**: each six-month rotation creates a "responsibility sink" where incoming presidencies inherit no institutional memory and outgoing presidencies transfer no accountability. The 18-month Trio system compounds this: Poland, Denmark, and Cyprus (the current Trio) have no contact with Ireland's domestic governance failures; Ireland, Lithuania, and Greece (the next Trio) will be too institutionally preoccupied with Council duties to audit Ireland's own record.

**The Strategic Window**: Ireland will hold the Presidency **while the ethics complaint remains suppressed** — creating a conflict of structural interest of the highest order:

- Ireland will chair Council meetings on civil protection coordination (TFEU Art. 196)
- Ireland will broker compromises on dual-use export controls (Reg. 428/2009)
- Ireland will represent the Council in trilogues with the Parliament and Commission
- All while concealing its own twenty-year breach of those same obligations

### B. The Trio System as Loose Architecture

**Article 3, Council Decision 2016/1316** requires Trios to prepare a **shared 18-month programme** of long-term goals and a common agenda.

For the Ireland/Lithuania/Greece Trio (2026–2027):

- **July–December 2026**: Ireland sets the agenda
- **January–June 2027**: Lithuania chairs; Ireland remains inside the Trio
- **July–December 2027**: Greece chairs; Ireland remains inside the Trio

For 18 months, Ireland will be **within the governance architecture** while simultaneously: suppressing its own ethics complaint; setting EU priorities on emergency preparedness; coordinating cross-border intelligence cooperation; and — per the structural logic of the nullification loop — effectively blocking any Commission investigation into its own TFEU Art. 196 breach.

This is not administrative failure. It is structural entrapment without functional self-discipline.

## Part III — Compendium of Stakeholders

### Tier I — The Constituent: Individual Citizens

**Irish Citizens** are the primary and foundational stakeholder. Every Irish citizen is affected by the downstream consequences of O.R. exclusion from public governance: suboptimal resource allocation in healthcare, housing, transport, asylum processing, emergency management, and national security. The citizen's standing is constitutional — Article 40.3 of Bunreacht na hÉireann guarantees the right to have one's rights vindicated by the State. Where procedural mechanisms systematically prevent citizens from accessing review, that constitutional guarantee is hollowed.

**EU Citizens Resident in Ireland** share the same exposure under Irish domestic governance failures, compounded by the State's role as lead data regulator for the world's largest data-processing entities. Their fundamental rights under the EU Charter are engaged wherever Irish regulatory capacity is undermined by the absence of systematic, O.R.-based risk assessment.

**EU Citizens Across All Member States** share risk in a deeper structural sense: Ireland's handling of EU data transfers, dual-use research, and rule-of-law obligations is not a matter of local concern. What one member state does — or fails to do — within the single market reverberates across shared commercial, security, and legal frameworks. The legal question posed to the CJEU is precisely this: if a member state may indefinitely acknowledge a risk without acting upon it, every member state may do the same, and the architecture of shared accountability collapses. All twenty-seven member states share risk and commerce and bear economic consequence in common.

### Tier II — Civil Society & Academic Bodies

Attempts were made to seek independent civil-society engagement. No substantive response has been received to date.

The bodies approached or with cognisable interest include:

**Academic & Research Institutions:** University of Galway (NUI Galway, School of Law — formally briefed; the Dean's response dismissed the legal implications out of hand; the subsequent rebuttal remains unanswered); Irish universities and research bodies with operations research, public policy, and governance mandates; the Irish Centre for Human Rights (multiple detailed emails sent; no response received).

**Legal Professional Bodies:** King's Inns; the Law Society of Ireland; the Law Society Gazette; members of the Inner Bar (Law Library); NUI Schools of Law — all formally briefed through the Memoranda. Outside of two exceptions, no substantive civil-society response has been received.

**International Human Rights Legal Practice:** Several Senior Counsel members notified, given the cross-border dimensions of the matter and the relevance of UN mechanisms and Council of Europe engagement.

**Media:** Press briefing materials have been prepared and published at https://github.com/dr-wojak/press. Growing public engagement has been recorded, with documented social media reach of over five thousand impressions in a single week as of February 2026, with an increasing trajectory.

**Think-Tanks & Policy Bodies:** The Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) was directly contacted on March 9th, 2025, and again on November 27th, 2025 (attention: Ms Heather Burke, Researcher, Future-Proofing Europe). No substantive response has been received.

**French Government — Délégation aux Affaires Stratégiques:** engaged in the period following the original November 11th, 2006 submission. Progress went cold and attention subsequently focused on Irish implementation. No follow-up engagement received.

---

### Tier III — The Oireachtas (National Parliament)

The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, and each of the following committees, have received formal submissions. Each has issued declination decisions citing remit, resulting in the documented nullification loop. In several cases, correspondence was not merely declined but returned and deleted from committee records.

**Joint Committee on Defence and National Security** (Ref: S-2025-0174-DEF)
— Cathaoirleach: Ms Rose Conway-Walsh TD

**Joint Committee on Justice, Home Affairs and Migration**
(Ref: R2025-0106, September 18th, 2025; Ref: R2025-0200, December 9th, 2025)
— Cathaoirleach: Mr Matt Carthy TD

**Committee on Budgetary Oversight**
(Ref: S-2025-0087-BOC, October 3rd, 2025; no response from Cathaoirleach O'Donoghue to email of April 19th, 2025)
— Cathaoirleach: Mr Richard O'Donoghue TD

**Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, and Taoiseach**
(Ref: S-2025-0207-FIN, October 3rd, 2025)
— Cathaoirleach: Ms Mairéad Farrell TD

**Joint Committee on European Union Affairs**
(Ref: JCEUA-I-57, October 7th, 2025)
— Cathaoirleach: Mr Barry Ward TD

**Committee on Public Petitions and the Ombudsmen**
— Petition refused transmission by the Clerk of Dáil Éireann (September 10th, 2025); rebuttals of September 24th, 2025 and October 30th, 2025 left unaddressed; decisions asserted as "final" and admitting "no rebuttal" — a position inconsistent with natural justice and Article 40.3; pre-action notification for judicial review issued December 2nd, 2025.
— Cathaoirleach: Ms Louise O'Reilly TD
— Leas-Chathaoirleach: Mr Jack Dolan TD

**Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade**
— Cathaoirleach: Mr John Lahart TD

**Seanad Éireann** — Senator Mark Daly, Cathaoirleach, formally requested to refer the matter to the Council of State given its constitutional dimensions.

**Supporting Officers:** Ms Anne-Marie Fahy, Clerk to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission; Mr John Callinan, Secretary General to the Government.

The cumulative effect of these declinations is the documented nullification loop: material of acknowledged national importance rendered permanently unreviewable through serial jurisdictional deflection, in apparent breach of Article 15.2.1 (the representative function of the Houses) and Article 28.3.1 (the Government's duty to execute law with functional mechanisms of oversight).

---

### Tier IV — The Executive (Government of Ireland)

**An Taoiseach, Mr Micheál Martin TD** — as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2009, verbal commitment to engage with the O.R. submission was given. He now serves again as Taoiseach, rendering him uniquely accountable to the twenty-year record. Formally engaged December 13th, 2025.

**An Tánaiste, Mr Simon Harris TD, Minister for Finance** — formally engaged December 13th, 2025.

**Ms Helen McEntee TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Minister for Defence** — formally engaged December 13th, 2025.

**Mr Thomas Byrne TD, Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence** — formally engaged December 13th, 2025.

**Mr Jack Chambers TD, Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Services, Reform and Digitalisation** — formally engaged December 13th, 2025.

The broader Government Departments engaged include the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Defence, and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The verbal commitment of then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, given at the time of the November 11th, 2006 submission, and that of then-Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin in 2009, remain unacted upon. The institutional pattern is acknowledgment without action — consistent across two decades, four governments, and multiple ministerial portfolios.

---

### Tier V — Irish Constitutional & Judicial Bodies

**The Council of State** — referral requested through the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann, Senator Mark Daly, given the constitutional dimensions of the matter, including the structural antinomy identified in Memorandum E.

**The High Court of Ireland** — pre-action notification for judicial review issued December 2nd, 2025. Preparation of a writ of mandamus to compel statutory action is underway. If denied, it would establish the precedent that governments may acknowledge national security risks and governance failures without any obligation to act.

**The Office of the Ombudsman** — within the oversight remit of the Committee on Public Petitions and the Ombudsmen, which has declined engagement.

---

### Tier VI — EU Institutions

**European Commission — Commissioner Michael McGrath** (Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law & Consumer Protection) — formally engaged November 27th, 2025, and again in subsequent correspondence. No substantive response received to date.

**Commissioner Hadja Lahbib** — copied on formal correspondence of November 27th, 2025.

**Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič** — copied on formal correspondence of November 27th, 2025.

**Joint Committee on European Union Affairs** — copied on relevant correspondence (Ref: JCEUA-I-57, October 7th, 2025).

**Court of Justice of the European Union** — correspondence directed to the Registry (ecj.registry@curia.europa.eu). The central justiciable question: *Can a Member State indefinitely avoid acting on risks it has acknowledged, without legal or institutional consequence?* Judge Eugene Regan of the CJEU formally engaged. No response received.

The EU-law dimensions formally engaged include: EU Regulation 428/2009 on Dual-Use Goods; the EU–US Data Privacy Framework and its predecessors (Safe Harbour, Privacy Shield) and associated data sovereignty obligations; Article 2 TEU (Rule of Law); Article 16(9) TEU and Article 236 TFEU (Council Presidency obligations); TFEU Article 196 (civil protection coordination); and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as applicable to Irish data governance and regulatory capacity.

As Ireland's lead regulator for the world's largest data-processing entities, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) operates within this failure context. Without O.R.-based systematic risk assessment, the sovereignty Ireland claims to exercise on behalf of the EU in data governance becomes, as Memorandum E documents, a legal fiction.

---

### Tier VII — Anglo-Irish & Bilateral Relations

**The United Kingdom Government** — formally apprised as of February 2026 (attention: Rt Hon Hilary Benn MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland). The matter now falls within the ambit of Anglo-Irish institutional oversight, implicating cross-border governance, security frameworks, and bilateral institutional credibility.

**The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly** — implicated by the cross-border dimensions of governance, security, and bilateral cooperation frameworks, and by the reputational consequences for both states of continued inaction.

**The British-Irish Association** — themes of trust, cooperation, and security overlap directly with the risks of continued inaction.

**Human rights legal practitioners** — expertise in UN mechanisms and Council of Europe engagement, given the cross-border character of the matter

**Cross-Border Crisis Management Structures** — bilateral security frameworks and joint emergency protocols are undermined wherever one party systematically excludes O.R.-based planning from its governance architecture. The governance asymmetry this creates in bilateral security planning was formally noted in the Anglo-Irish engagement of February 2026.

---

### Tier VIII — Multilateral & Member State Relations

Given Ireland's forthcoming EU Council Presidency (July 1st, 2026), the governance failure documented here is no longer a domestic matter in any practical sense. Every EU member state that will interact with Ireland in its capacity as Presidency holder has a legitimate interest in the credibility of Ireland's rule-of-law record and the integrity of its governance architecture.

The Ireland/Lithuania/Greece Trio arrangement means that for the full 18-month period from July 1st, 2026 to December 31st, 2027, Ireland will remain inside the EU's core governance architecture — shaping the legislative agenda, chairing Council bodies, and representing the Council in trilogues — while the underlying suppression of the ethics complaint remains unaddressed.

Direct engagement with EU capitals — to ensure the governance risks documented in this case are understood beyond Irish borders, particularly by member states whose interactions with Ireland during the Presidency term will be most intensive — is planned in the absence of substantive institutional response from the Commission.
