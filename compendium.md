For the purpose of judicial review and technical accuracy, it is essential to first distinguish between two distinct EU leadership roles: the **Presidency of the Council of the European Union** (a rotating role held by Member State governments) and the **President of the European Council** (a permanent individual position, currently held by **António Costa**).

The information below details the "rota" for the **Presidency of the Council of the European Union**.

---

### I. Legal Basis and Governance

The rotation of the Presidency is governed by **Article 16(9)** of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and **Article 236** of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The current specific order was established by **Council Decision (EU) 2016/1316**, which revised the schedule through December 31, 2030, following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.

### II. Rotation Schedule (2024–2030)

The Presidency rotates every six months. As of today, **February 26, 2026**, the Presidency is held by **Cyprus**.

+1

|**Year**|**January – June**|**July – December**|
|---|---|---|
|**2024**|Belgium|Hungary|
|**2025**|Poland|Denmark|
|**2026**|**Cyprus** (Current)|**Ireland** (Upcoming)|
|**2027**|Lithuania|Greece|
|**2028**|Italy|Latvia|
|**2029**|Luxembourg|Netherlands|
|**2030**|Slovakia|Malta|

> **Note:** Per Article 3 of Decision 2016/1316, the Council must determine the order for the period beginning January 1, 2031, no later than December 31, 2029.

### III. The "Trio" System

To ensure continuity across the six-month terms, Member States work in groups of three, known as **"Trios."** These trios prepare a shared 18-month program of long-term goals and a common agenda.

- **Current Trio (2025–2026):** Poland, Denmark, and Cyprus.
    
- **Next Trio (2026–2027):** Ireland, Lithuania, and Greece.
    

### IV. Functional Responsibilities

The Member State holding the Presidency is responsible for:

1. **Chairing Meetings:** Leading sessions of the Council (except the Foreign Affairs Council, which is chaired by the High Representative).
    
2. **Agenda Setting:** Determining the priority of legislative files and brokering compromises between Member States.
    
3. **Representation:** Representing the Council in negotiations with other EU institutions, such as the European Parliament and the Commission (trilogues).
