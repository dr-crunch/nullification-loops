# Judicial Review

For the purpose of judicial review and technical accuracy, it is essential to first distinguish between two distinct EU leadership roles: the **Presidency of the Council of the European Union** (a rotating role held by Member State governments) and the **President of the European Council** (a permanent individual position, currently held by **António Costa**).

**Legal Question for CJEU**:

> "Can a Member State lawfully hold the Council Presidency while suppressing an ethics complaint that documents its own breach of Treaty obligations in areas within the Presidency's functional responsibilities?"

The information below details the "rota" for the **Presidency of the Council of the European Union**.

---

### I. Legal Basis and Governance

The rotation of the Presidency is governed by **Article 16(9)** of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and **Article 236** of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The current specific order was established by **Council Decision (EU) 2016/1316**, which revised the schedule through December 31, 2030, following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.

### II. Rotation Schedule (2024–2030)

The Presidency rotates every six months. As of today, **February 26, 2026**, the Presidency is held by **Cyprus**.

|**Year**|**January – June**|**July – December**|
|---|---|---|
|**2024**|Belgium|Hungary|
|**2025**|Poland|Denmark|
|**2026**|**Cyprus** (Current)|**Ireland** (Upcoming)|
|**2027**|Lithuania|Greece|
|**2028**|Italy|Latvia|
|**2029**|Luxembourg|Netherlands|
|**2030**|Slovakia|Malta|

> **Note:** Per Article 3 of Decision 2016/1316, the Council must determine the order for the period beginning January 1, 2031, no later than December 31, 2029.

### III. The "Trio" System

To ensure continuity across the six-month terms, Member States work in groups of three, known as **"Trios."** These trios prepare a shared 18-month program of long-term goals and a common agenda.

- **Current Trio (2025–2026):** Poland, Denmark, and Cyprus.
    
- **Next Trio (2026–2027):** Ireland, Lithuania, and Greece.
    
STRUCTURAL ENTRAPMENT

#### **A. The Rotating Presidency as Accountability Dissolution Mechanism**

From the judicial review documentation:

**Current Trio (2025–2026)**: Poland, Denmark, Cyprus  
**Next Trio (2026–2027)**: **Ireland**, Lithuania, Greece

**The Temporal Trap**:

- Ireland assumes EU Council Presidency: **July 1, 2026** (in 4 months)
- Ethics complaint suppression: **2006–2026** (20 years)
- **Nullification Loop**: Each 6-month rotation creates a "responsibility sink" where:
    - Incoming presidency inherits no institutional memory
    - Outgoing presidency transfers no accountability
    - **The 18-month Trio system ensures collective dilution**: Poland/Denmark/Cyprus (current) never touch Ireland's domestic governance failures; Ireland/Lithuania/Greece (next) will be too busy with Council duties to audit Ireland's own records

**The Strategic Window**: Ireland will hold the Presidency **while the ethics complaint remains suppressed**—creating the ultimate conflict of interest:

- Ireland chairs Council meetings on civil protection coordination (TFEU 196)
- Ireland brokers compromises on dual-use export controls (Reg 428/2009)
- Ireland represents the Council in trilogues with Parliament/Commission
- **All while concealing its own 20-year breach of these same obligations**

---

#### **B. The Trio System as Loose Architecture**

**Article 3, Council Decision 2016/1316**:

> Trios prepare a **shared 18-month program** of long-term goals and a common agenda.

**The Ireland/Lithuania/Greece Trio (2026–2027)**:

- **July–Dec 2026**: Ireland sets agenda
- **Jan–Jun 2027**: Lithuania chairs (Ireland still in Trio)
- **Jul–Dec 2027**: Greece chairs (Ireland still in Trio)

**The Nullification Loop**: For 18 months, Ireland will be **inside the governance architecture** while:

1. Suppressing its own ethics complaint
2. Setting EU priorities on emergency preparedness
3. Coordinating cross-border intelligence cooperation
4. **Blocking any Commission investigation into its own TFEU 196 breach**

**This is not administrative failure. This is structural entrapment without functional self-discipline.**

### IV. Functional Responsibilities

The Member State holding the Presidency is responsible for:

1. **Chairing Meetings:** Leading sessions of the Council (except the Foreign Affairs Council, which is chaired by the High Representative).
    
2. **Agenda Setting:** Determining the priority of legislative files and brokering compromises between Member States.
    
3. **Representation:** Representing the Council in negotiations with other EU institutions, such as the European Parliament and the Commission (trilogues).
