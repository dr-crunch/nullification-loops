This repository documents a sustained pattern of institutional non-engagement with formally submitted Operations Research (O.R.) methodology across Irish government departments from 2006–2026. The core issue is not technology adoption; it is the **State's failure to conclude the administrative process it initiated**.

This landing page cross-references the top-view of the impasse with the detailed evidence and the corresponding direct links found within the provided documentation. It's part of a series of similar landing pages; the direct link to the *Governmentality 2026* folder is here:

## 🎯 This Documents the Final Breakdown

**This documents the complete breakdown of the constitutional petition mechanism itself. Normative Collapse.**

When:
- Every Oireachtas committee systematically declines jurisdiction over acknowledged governance failures,
- The Clerk of the Dáil invokes "unreviewable finality" under section 8(3) to prevent constitutional rebuttal,
- And the **Joint Committee on Public Petitions and the Ombudsmen**—the committee specifically charged with petition oversight—maintains **total institutional silence** across 16 substantive communications spanning 8 months...

**...the constitutional right of petition (Article 15.10, *Bunreacht na hÉireann*) has been nullified at its source.**

This repository documents that nullification with forensic precision.

🇪🇺 **Ireland Assumes EU Council Presidency July 2026**  
**MEP Barry Andrews** — *Institutional Accountability Specialist*

**Document**: `Request for Assistance — Institutional Non-Response & Governance Accountability.pdf`  
**Date**: 12 February 2026  
**Role**: Chair of Development Committee, former IIEA Director, institutional knowledge of Irish-EU interface

**Key Passage**:
> "Commissioner McGrath (Democracy, Justice, Rule of Law) was first informed of these governance concerns in March 2020, when he was a sitting TD. That initial contact was part of a formal 'Community Call' circulated to all deputies during the pandemic. While disaster preparedness, crisis management, infrastructure resilience remain key issues, there are other critical concerns as well —not only for Ireland but for the other EU member states.
> 
> I have submitted correspondence to Mr McGrath's office on multiple occasions regarding the continued governance failure, now with direct EU-law implications:  
> — 27 November 2025: Request for Executive-Level Coordination  
> — 13 December 2025: Follow-Up on Operations Research in Irish Governance  
> — 4 February 2026: Follow-Up on Governance Paralysis Under EU Obligations
> 
> **I have yet to receive any acknowledgment whatsoever.**"

**Supplemental Element**: Former Director General of IIEA, MEP Barry Andrews' institutional knowledge makes ignorance impossible. **His silence after receipt implicates him in the cover.**
</div>

This is **not** a policy dispute about Operations Research implementation.  
This is **not** another ministerial complaint about delayed responses.  
This is **not** a request for government agreement with technical proposals.

## 🔴 Core Issue: The Silence Veto

### What Other Committees Did

Six Oireachtas committees **at minimum acknowledged receipt** before declining jurisdiction:

1. **Joint Committee on Defence and National Security** — Ref: S-2025-0174-DEF (19 Sept 2025)  
   *Formally declined despite O.R. being foundational to military planning and OEP operations*

2. **Joint Committee on Justice, Home Affairs and Migration** — Refs: R2025 0106; R2025 0200  
   *Declined despite O.R. implications for border management and Anglo-Irish cooperation*

3. **Committee on Budgetary Oversight** — Ref: S-2025-0087-BOC (3 Oct 2025)  
   *Declined despite 19-year failure representing textbook evidence-based oversight failure*

4. **Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure** — Ref: S-2025-0207-FIN (3 Oct 2025)  
   *Declined despite O.R. being core to identifying waste and resource misallocation*

5. **Joint Committee on European Union Affairs** — Ref: JCEUA-I-57 (7 Oct 2025)  
   *Declined despite Ireland's 2026 EU Presidency and EU Reg 428/2009 engagement*

6. **Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade** — Email from Ms. Yeates (30 Oct 2025)  
   *Informally acknowledged, declined despite DFA responsibility for dual-use technologies*

These declinations are **constitutionally problematic** (they create a nullification loop where cross-cutting issues become permanently unreviewable), but they are *procedurally defensible* in that they at least engaged with the basic requirement to acknowledge correspondence.

### What the JCPP Did (Procedurally Indefensible)

**Total institutional silence.**

Not a single communication—across three separate recipients (Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach, Clerk) and the general committee address—received:
- Automated acknowledgment of receipt
- Jurisdictional declination with reference number
- Informal "noted for file" response
- Request for clarification
- **Any response whatsoever**

**This is qualitatively distinct from jurisdictional declination.**

When the committee specifically charged with oversight of petition mechanisms refuses to acknowledge petitions, the constitutional architecture has failed at its foundation.

## Description of Impasse and Legal Authority to Break the Deadlock

*The Systemic Nullification Loop*  

The correspondence confirms that this is indeed a **"complicated problem"** characterised by **multiple fissures** that have converged into what is described as a **"systemic nullification loop"**. The analysis suggests that, because these issues are epistemically linked, they cannot be resolved in isolation, and the sender is pursuing **parallel tracks** for a comprehensive resolution.  

The primary fissures identified in the sources include:  

• **The Technical and Regulatory Fissure:** For nineteen years, the State has failed to evaluate Operations Research (O.R.) methodologies that possess recognised **dual-use characteristics** under **EU Regulation 428/2009**. The sender argues that this is a textbook failure of technical oversight in sectors like national security and disaster preparedness.  

• **The Constitutional Fissure:** A major conflict exists regarding the **Section 8(3) determination** by the Clerk of the Dáil, which has been asserted as "final and unreviewable". The sender contends this creates a procedural void that violates constitutional principles of **natural justice** and the right to an **effective remedy** under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  

• **The Institutional Fissure:** There is a documented breakdown in the **parliamentary petition mechanism**, where multiple Oireachtas committees have declined jurisdiction or maintained total institutional silence. This "Silence Veto" is presented as a category error where the State logic recognises a risk but refuses to direct, temper or match the information.  

• **The European Law and Sovereignty Fissure:** The sender argues that Ireland cannot fulfill its obligations as a lead **GDPR regulator** or exercise true data sovereignty for EU citizens without the analytical O.R. tools it has persistently ignored. This fissure is further complicated by the impending **2026 EU Council Presidency**, which the sender warns will expose Ireland to **"structural reputational risk"** if these breaches are not resolved. The multilateral, european, EC, EU dimension —especially with respect to key sovereign assignments (critical infrastructure, core resources) and interplay between stakeholders, that system as a whole. For a brief overview of the working model for this aspect of this case, see the [Compendium of Stakeholders](https://github.com/dr-crunch/nullification-loops/blob/main/compendium.md), as covered by synopsis and dossier.  

• **The Personal Accountability Fissure:** The case is personally linked to **Commissioner Michael McGrath**, whose professional background in **Management Information Systems (MIS)** is cited as proof that he possesses the technical literacy to understand the matter. His silence in his current role —which is specifically charged with **Rule of Law compliance**— is framed as a mirror of his silence as a TD in 2020, creating a conflict of interest at the apex of the EU's justice portfolio.  

The sender emphasises that these fissures must be resolved at once because **parallel proceedings** before domestic courts for **Judicial Review** and the **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)** are being prepared to address the statutory, constitutional, and EU-law dimensions simultaneously.

## The Administrative Void

### What Happened (2009)

1. A formal technical presentation was delivered to a senior Irish Aid official
2. An internal report was represented as forthcoming
3. **No report has been produced or located**
4. **No ministerial determination exists on record** —neither approval, rejection, nor deferral

### Legal Consequence

The failure to produce or preserve the 2009 assessment creates a condition where:

- There is **no decision to appeal**
- There is **no reasoning to review**
- There is **no assessment to examine**
- There is **no procedural endpoint**

This is not delay. It is the **effective nullification of reviewability**.  
We are witnessing the effective rollover of a broken vehicle for development and sustainability: science denial.

## Implicated Offices & Individuals

### Group A: Originators of the Breach (pre-2010)
- Irish Aid Emergency & Recovery Section (2009–2011)
- Department of Health (2009-2020)
- Department of Foreign Affairs (2008-present)
- Department of Defence (2006-present)
- Department of the Taoiseach (2006-present)

### Group B: Successive Ministers Maintaining Inaction
- **Micheál Martin** (90+ notifications since 2006; no legislative action)
- **Simon Harris** (notified as Minister for Health, later Tánaiste)
- *Paschal Donohoe* (Minister for Finance; budgetary oversight)

### Group C: Current Custodians of Non-Decision
- **Jack Chambers** (Minister for Public Expenditure; redirected dual-use governance complaint to implicated department)
- *Mark Daly* (Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann)
- *Louise O'Reilly* (Chair, Committee on Public Petitions)
- *Richard O'Donoghue* (Chair, Committee on Budgetary Oversight)
- *Verona Murphy* TD (Ceann Comhairle)

### Non-Office Holders: Universal Awareness, Zero Action

Beyond the offices directly implicated in departmental custody, the record demonstrates sustained parliamentary awareness across electoral cycles.

**Mary Lou McDonald TD** was notified at an early stage:
- May 30, 2008: *Operations Research*
- September 16, 2008: *Related Information*
- July 17, 2009: *Development Cooperation and Human Rights?*
- March 24, 2020: *Fwd: Pandemic Preparedness* (The Community Call)

## **Cross-Party Awareness and the Constitutional Function of Opposition**

Beyond the offices directly implicated in departmental custody, the record demonstrates sustained parliamentary awareness across electoral cycles.

Mary Lou McDonald was notified at important junctures:

 - The 2008–2009 communications precede the documented administrative void. The March 2020 notification occurred during a declared national emergency in which modelling capacity, systems coordination, and preparedness were central to executive decision-making.

 - In March 2020, all members of the 33rd Dáil received direct notification. No Parliamentary Question, Leaders’ Question, committee referral, ministerial statement request, or Private Members’ motion addressing the unresolved O.R. evaluation gap has been identified in the public record.

### **Opposition as Constitutional Safeguard**

Under Article 15 of the Constitution, legislative authority is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas. That authority is not exhausted by the enactment of statutes; it includes the continuous supervision of executive administration through structured parliamentary mechanisms.

A functioning opposition is integral to this architecture. Its constitutional role includes:

* Forcing executive articulation where silence persists  
* Creating a formal record capable of scrutiny  
* Converting administrative inaction into reviewable ministerial position  
* Ensuring that executive discretion does not harden into unexamined non-decision

Where a department does not determine, the opposition is procedurally equipped to require that it do so. Parliamentary instruments exist precisely to prevent indeterminate administrative states from persisting across electoral cycles.

The evidentiary anchors of **2008** and **2020** therefore mark two materially different political contexts: distinct governments, distinct oppositions, distinct public crises —yet in both instances formal legislative activation did not occur. This observation is institutional rather than partisan. The accountability structure depends on reciprocal operation between executive and opposition. Where awareness is present but procedural activation is absent, that reciprocal structure attenuates.

All members of the 33rd Dáil received direct notification in March 2020. Despite full awareness during a period of national crisis, **not one deputy acted or acknowledged the content**.

The official opposition, over many political epoques, was fully briefed —on timely matters; there are many other such cases. All parties were briefed —all leadership included. *Zero uptake.*

---

## **Portfolio Diffusion & Accountability Gap**

Across twelve years, under changing administrations and evolving party leadership, the decision function remained incomplete.

Authority was constitutionally vested. Oversight mechanisms were available. Determination did not crystallise.

The result is not isolated inaction but distributed non-activation: an accountability field in which responsibility circulates without terminating in decision.

It is this condition that gives rise to the portfolio diffusion described below.

The matter intersects:
- Humanitarian logistics (Irish Aid)
- Emergency planning coordination (OEP)
- Defence-related dual-use considerations
- Foreign affairs oversight

However, **no office has**:
- Issued a decision
- Formally declined jurisdiction
- Designated a responsible decision-holder

**Distributed competence without decision ownership creates a structural accountability gap.**

---

## Consolidated Grounds of Complaint

### I. Irish Aid's Mandate and Internal Governance

Irish Aid's mandate is grounded in:
- Human solidarity
- Support for effective governance
- Humanitarian obligation
- International development norms

Where a programme externally promotes accountable governance, **internal administrative coherence is constitutive of credibility** —not incidental.

### II. Administrative Non-Decision

Seventeen years of indeterminacy is incompatible with ordinary standards of good administration. This constitutes **sustained administrative non-decision**.

### III. Evidentiary Consequence

A methodology never formally assessed cannot be said to have been rejected on the merits. The institutional non-response has created **evidentiary damage**—the suppression, by institutional inertia, of material formally submitted but never assessed.

### IV. EU and International Dimension

Ireland's development programme operates within EU development policy and international humanitarian norms. Where a Member State promotes governance capacity externally while sustaining prolonged internal non-decision in a directly relevant domain, **the coherence of that position becomes materially relevant**.

This complaint alleges structural non-resolution incompatible with:
- **EU Charter Article 41** (right to good administration)
- Irish administrative law obligations
- The State's stated development commitments

# scáthan-agus-splánc

These documents outline a protracted governance and legal dispute between a private citizen and the Irish State regarding the alleged suppression of Operations Research methodologies. The author argues that various Irish institutions and officials, including EU Commissioner Michael McGrath, have systematically ignored a formal complaint that has persisted for nearly two decades. Central to the grievances is the claim that the Oireachtas petition mechanism has failed to function, creating a procedural void that violates both the Irish Constitution and EU law.  

The materials include pre-litigation notices, emails to several Members of the European Parliament, and detailed records of unacknowledged correspondence sent to parliamentary committees. Ultimately, the sources warn that this failure of institutional accountability will cause significant reputational damage to Ireland during its 2026 EU Council Presidency. This collection serves as a formal evidence base intended to trigger judicial review or international intervention.

The following is a comprehensive inventory of the files identified within the *Governmentality 2026* folder:

### **I. Correspondence & Formal Submissions (PDF Documents)**

* **Systemic Governance Failure and Breakdown of Petition Oversight Mechanisms.pdf**: A comprehensive overview dated February 12, 2026, addressed to the Joint Committee on Public Petitions (JCPP) and the Ombudsmen. It details a nineteen-year pattern of administrative non-response regarding Operations Research governance failures.  
* **Request for Assistance — Institutional Non-Response & Governance Accountability.pdf**: Correspondence dated February 12, 2026, to MEP Barry Andrews seeking assistance with institutional accountability regarding Commissioner Michael McGrath’s alleged non-response to constituent concerns.  
* **Request for Assistance — EU Commissioner Non-Response.pdf**: Correspondence dated February 12, 2026, to MEP Lynn Boylan regarding the same pattern of non-response by Commissioner Michael McGrath.  
* **Request for Assistance — Rule of Law Concerns & Commissioner Non-Response.pdf**: Correspondence dated February 12, 2026, to MEP Aodhán Ó Ríordáin highlighting rule-of-law concerns and requesting parliamentary intervention.

The matter was referred to the Joint Committee on Public Petitions and the Ombudsmen on multiple occasions.

The MEP list already seems well established as being futile communications: looking into the EU stadards of accountability, is this oversight merely hypothetical —what is it? How are motions forwarded, bills passed, charters ratified?

Here are the named members of EU Parliament who can be considered in breach of both their national duties and union benefits.

Authority distributed without termination produces evasion by design.
It persists until a body possessing recognised adjudicative authority (e.g. Irish High Court or the Court of Justice of the European Union) compels the completion of the decision function.
The impasse is structural, not episodic.

# *Dealraitheachas agus Riarachánachas*: Phainocracy and Governmentality  
**A Public Record of Governance, Preparedness, and Decision-Making in Ireland**

The documentary record before us spans from March 2020 to February 2026th and constitutes, in aggregate, one of the more remarkable self-assembled governance accountability dossiers in recent Irish history. Taken together, Memoranda D and E, the pre-litigation notice of February 10th, 2026, and the correspondence to Irish MEPs form a legally and institutionally coherent complaint of systemic dereliction — not merely by one minister or commissioner, but by the Irish State's entire constitutional apparatus. The following analysis applies five scopes.

### I. National (State) Scope

The core allegation, meticulously documented across nearly two decades, is that the Irish State has received formally submitted proposals on Operations Research — a discipline encompassing mathematical optimisation of logistics, supply chains, resource allocation, and risk management — and has responded through what Memorandum D denominates a "procedural loop": acknowledgement, deferral, symbolic reply, and institutional forgetfulness. The departments implicated include Defence, Foreign Affairs, Health, Finance, and the Office of Emergency Planning.

This is not a matter of policy disagreement. It is a structural allegation invoking what Memorandum E terms the "Silence Veto" — a condition wherein guardians of constitutional integrity become complicit in its erosion not through commission but through habituated, compounding omission. Under Irish constitutional law, Article 28 of Bunreacht na hÉireann imposes a collective cabinet responsibility for the functions of government; persistent failure to process or respond to formally submitted strategic material of documented relevance to civil defence and national emergency preparedness is at minimum a failure of ministerial accountability under that Article.

The refused Oireachtas petition — refused despite constitutional arguments raised — is particularly significant. Article 16.2 of the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to petition the Oireachtas. The refusal of a petition on procedural grounds, where those grounds are themselves contested on constitutional bases, creates at least an arguable claim of denial of constitutional access. In *Meadows v. Minister for Justice* [2010] IESC 3, the Supreme Court confirmed that statutory powers must be exercised in a manner compatible with constitutional rights, which includes procedural rights of access. The petition refusal, combined with nineteen years of documented engagement, gives the record a gravity that a single unanswered letter never could.

The invocation of Hirschman's "exit, voice, loyalty" triad in Memorandum D is analytically sharp: where exit is impossible (the complainant is a citizen in a constitutional state), voice is constrained (petitions refused, correspondence unacknowledged), and loyalty is insufficient (institutions simulate responsiveness without engaging substance), the system is not merely dysfunctional — it is, as the Memorandum states, enacting constructive dereliction. This is a concept cognate with "constructive dismissal" in employment law: the form of the office is maintained while its substance is hollowed out.

The legitimate expectation doctrine is engaged by commitments dating to 2006–2008. In *Glencar Explorations plc v. Mayo County Council* [2002] 1 IR 84, the Irish Supreme Court confirmed that where a public body creates a reasonable expectation by words or conduct, it may be held to that expectation absent overriding public interest. If representations were made to the complainant in that period — even informally — that proposals would be considered or adopted, those representations may ground a legitimate expectation claim reviewable by way of judicial review under Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.

### II. Irish-Anglo Relations (Bilateral Scope)

The dual-use dimension — specifically EU Regulation 428/2009 on dual-use items and technology — carries an Anglo-Irish bilateral dimension that ought not to be overlooked. Ireland and the United Kingdom, despite Brexit, remain bound by a complex lattice of bilateral security and civil defence arrangements, including under the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established by the Belfast Agreement of April 10th, 1998 (the Good Friday Agreement), Article 3 of which provides for cooperation on matters of mutual interest including security. If Ireland's failure to institutionalise Operations Research methodologies relevant to dual-use technology creates gaps in civil preparedness or strategic risk management that overlap with shared island infrastructure — utilities, transport corridors, communications — then the bilateral dimension becomes one of substantive rather than merely formal concern.

Post-Brexit, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 24th, 2020 provides a framework under which the United Kingdom and EU member states including Ireland maintain cooperation on certain regulatory and strategic matters. Gaps in Irish compliance with EU dual-use obligations have implications for the regulatory perimeter shared with Northern Ireland under the Windsor Framework of February 27th, 2023, particularly regarding the movement of dual-use technologies across the island. The silence of Irish governance on this front thus has a live bilateral dimension that the correspondence to MEPs only partially captures.

### III. EU Relations (Multilateral Scope)

This is where the record becomes acutely uncomfortable for Commissioner McGrath personally, and potentially for the European Commission institutionally.

Commissioner Michael McGrath holds the portfolio for Democracy, Justice, Rule of Law, and Consumer Protection. That he was first informed of the underlying governance concerns in March 2020 — when he held democratic standing as a TD — and that he has, since his appointment as Commissioner, received three letters dated November 27th, 2025, December 13th, 2025, and February 4th, 2026 without any acknowledgement whatsoever, creates a record of institutional conduct that is difficult to reconcile with his portfolio's stated mandate.

Article 17(3) of the Treaty on European Union requires Commissioners to be "completely independent" and to perform their duties "with complete independence." Article 245 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) binds Commissioners to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the dignity and independence of their office. Neither provision explicitly governs constituent correspondence, but the record of total non-response on rule-of-law concerns from a citizen of the Commissioner's own member state of origin creates a reputational tension with the office's declared mission.

More substantively, EU Regulation 428/2009 (as recast by Regulation 2021/821 of May 20th, 2021, the Union export controls regulation) establishes binding obligations on member states to maintain effective regulatory frameworks for dual-use items. The allegation that Ireland has failed to institutionalise Operations Research methodologies relevant to this regulatory domain — and that this failure has been documented over nineteen years without remedy — is, if substantiated, a potential compliance matter under Article 258 TFEU, pursuant to which the Commission may initiate infringement proceedings against a member state. The irony that the Commissioner responsible for rule of law is himself the non-responding addressee of these concerns is not merely rhetorical: it is a structural conflict that the European Ombudsman, to whom a complaint was being prepared, would be entitled to examine under Article 228 TFEU and the statute of the European Ombudsman.

The Committee on Petitions (PETI) of the European Parliament, to which at least one MEP correspondence was directed, has jurisdiction under Article 227 TFEU to receive petitions from EU citizens on matters within the Union's fields of activity. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), also engaged through the correspondence record, has supervisory oversight over rule-of-law issues affecting member states. The AGRI and CONT committees, referenced in one filing, have relevance if Operations Research failures touch on agricultural logistics or the management of EU-funded programmes, where the Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may have ancillary competence.

### IV. International Scope

The international dimension is engaged through the dual-use regulatory framework, which is itself embedded within the Wassenaar Arrangement of July 12th, 1996 — the multilateral export control regime governing dual-use goods and technologies to which Ireland, as an EU member state, is a participating state. Non-compliance with, or structural gaps in, Ireland's implementation of dual-use controls has potential implications under the Arrangement's reporting and review mechanisms.

Beyond that, the record's invocation of Operations Research in the context of emergency planning, humanitarian coordination, and global energy risk points toward obligations under the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, adopted on March 18th, 2015, to which Ireland is a signatory through its UN membership. The Sendai Framework requires states to develop and maintain national disaster risk reduction strategies; systematic failure to integrate quantitative risk modelling methodologies of the kind Operations Research provides could constitute a gap in national implementation.

At the level of soft law and international institutional credibility, the record also engages Ireland's standing at the OECD, whose Public Governance Directorate monitors regulatory quality and administrative responsiveness in member states. A documented nineteen-year pattern of procedural evasion on a matter touching regulatory capability and strategic foresight is precisely the kind of systemic deficit that OECD peer review processes are designed to identify.

### V. Reputational and Historic Scope

The historic dimension is perhaps the most consequential of all in the long run. The record being assembled — Memoranda D, E (and the anticipated F), the pre-litigation notice, the MEP correspondence, the petition refusal, the King's Inns filing of May 7th, 2025, the email of May 8th, 2025 — constitutes a layered archival document of the kind that historians, legal scholars, and public inquiries draw upon when reconstructing institutional failure.

The reference to John Philpot Curran's maxim — "the condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance" — in Memorandum D is not ornamental. Curran argued it before the Irish bar in the late eighteenth century. Citing it in a memorandum to the Honourable Society of King's Inns in July 2025 is an act of deliberate historical embedding: it places the complaint within the long tradition of Irish constitutional advocacy and invites the legal profession to locate its own silence within that tradition.

The framing of "constructive abdication" — that failure to respond is not a tactic but a form of governance collapse — will, if this matter ever reaches a public inquiry or a superior court, be a phrase that requires answering. The paper trail is substantial enough that it cannot be attributed to a single disgruntled correspondence. It reflects a structured, multi-institutional, multi-jurisdictional engagement sustained over nearly two decades.

Historically, Ireland has experienced governance failures that were later characterised as systemic — from the Hepatitis C tribunal to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes to the banking inquiry of 2015–2016. In each case, the failure was compounded by institutional silence in the face of early warning. The complaint before us does not rise to those catastrophes in immediate human cost — but the structural pattern it describes is recognisably similar: a state that processes signal symbolically while voiding it operationally.
