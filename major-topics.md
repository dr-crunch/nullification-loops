**Major Topics:**

**The Foundational Claim**

**A sovereign governance capability has been submitted, acknowledged, and systematically withheld from implementation for nineteen years.**

This is the ground. Everything else is consequence or context. The capability is Operations Research / AI governance methodology. The jurisdiction is Ireland. The timeline is 2006–present. The author is a French-Canadian national with right of abode in the UK and EU citizenship — which immediately makes this a **multi-sovereign matter**, not a domestic Irish complaint.

**The Structural Mechanism**

**The Nullification Loop / Silence Veto**

This is the named mechanism by which the foundational claim has been suppressed. It is not incidental — it is the *object of study* in its own right. Its five operational modes (remit displacement, acknowledgement-as-closure, deferral without destination, sufficiency assertion, record suppression) are documented, repeatable, and cross-institutional.

For the cohort, this is the most *transferable* topic. The nullification loop is not an Irish invention. It will be recognisable to any state actor who has watched a cross-cutting governance matter dissolve between ministries. **This is the entry point for France, Latvia, Cyprus — states that do not share Ireland's institutional memory but will immediately recognise the mechanism.**

**The Legal Exposure**

Three distinct legal tracks, running in parallel:

**3a. Irish Constitutional Law** — Article 40.3, *audi alteram partem*, section 8(3) of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, writ of mandamus before the High Court. The Clerk of the Dáil is the proximate respondent. The petition mechanism has been structurally nullified.

**3b. EU Law** — Dual-Use Regulation (Reg. 428/2009 / recast 2021/821), Article 2 TEU, EU Charter Articles 41 and 47, data sovereignty post-Safe Harbour. The CJEU Registry and Judge Eugene Regan have been formally notified. Commissioner McGrath holds infringement powers and is on the evidentiary record.

**3c. Property Law / Conversion** — 26 kilograms of proprietary research materials retained by the Irish State for nineteen years without lawful basis or compensation. A compounding tort. Costs accrue weekly.

For the cohort: **3b is the shared jurisdictional ground**. Every state in the cohort is an EU Member State or closely linked to EU legal architecture. The question — *can a Member State indefinitely defer acknowledged obligations without consequence?* — is a question for all of them.

**The McGrath Dimension**

This is the most precisely ironic and legally pointed single fact in the entire corpus:

The individual now charged with initiating EU infringement procedures against Member States for rule-of-law failures first received notification of this governance failure in March and April of 2020, as a sitting TD. He did not act. He is now European Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, and the Rule of Law. He has still not responded — in either capacity.

His professional background (Head of MIS at UCC, Fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Minister for Finance) establishes beyond dispute that he has the technical literacy to engage with the material. His silence is not explicable by ignorance. It is part of the evidentiary record.

For the cohort: this is **not a political attack on an individual**. It is a structural observation about what happens when the person most qualified and most obligated to act is also the person most embedded in the architecture that has failed. The European Council, France, Cyprus, Latvia — all have an interest in whether their Commissioner for the Rule of Law is responsive to documented rule-of-law failures on his own national doorstep.

**The Anglo-Irish / Bilateral Dimension**

The corpus extends formally into British-Irish relations: the Northern Ireland Office, the Secretary of State (Rt Hon Hilary Benn MP), the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, Matrix Chambers. The O.R. omission is framed as a cross-border governance asymmetry — Ireland and the UK cannot coordinate effectively on infrastructure, emergency preparedness, security, or fiscal efficiency if one side of the border lacks the analytical capability the other side depends upon.

Storm Éowyn and Storm Darragh are the concrete case studies. Cross-jurisdictional crisis response failed. The failure is demonstrable, recent, and publicly legible.

For the cohort: **this is the entry point for non-EU actors and for any state concerned with NATO-adjacent security architecture** — Latvia in particular, given its security posture.

**The France / DAS Dimension**

The Directorate of Strategic Affairs (DAS) opened a dossier in 2007 under M. Jean de Ponton d'Amécourt, subsequently under M. Miraillet. France engaged earlier than any other external actor. That engagement went cold. The most recent correspondence invokes administrative continuity from that original engagement and formally requests that France assume a leadership role.

France is also the author's national state. That changes the diplomatic register considerably. A French national, resident in Ireland, holding EU citizenship and UK right of abode, whose proprietary research has been retained without compensation for nineteen years by an EU Member State, is invoking the protection of his home state. This is a matter of **consular and diplomatic standing**, not merely academic interest.

For the cohort: **France is the natural convener**. It has prior institutional knowledge through DAS, a national interest through citizenship, and the strategic weight to raise the matter at Council level without it appearing as a bilateral grievance between Ireland and a smaller state.

**The Derivation in Summary**

Read as a single structure, the corpus yields six nested topics:

1. **The withheld capability** — OR/AI governance methodology, turnkey since 2006  
2. **The suppression mechanism** — the Nullification Loop / Silence Veto, documented and named  
3. **The legal exposure** — Irish constitutional law, EU law, property law / conversion  
4. **The McGrath dimension** — infringement competence meeting documented silence  
5. **The Anglo-Irish dimension** — bilateral governance asymmetry, storm failures as case study  
6. **The France/DAS dimension** — prior engagement, citizenship, diplomatic standing, convening role

Each topic has its own register — legal, diplomatic, technical, humanitarian, constitutional. Together they form a single, coherent case for **state-level intervention** that is no longer addressable by any single institution acting alone.

**The question is the actual viability of Ireland's Council Presidency in terms of EU standards, international standard, ethical frameworks and legal doctrine —this in light of France's convening authority, and the public record that is already indexed and growing.**
