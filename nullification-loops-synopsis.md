# The Impasse: Named and Framed

## What Is Actually Happening

I have spent nearly two decades — from 2006 to the present — formally submitting Operations Research (O.R.) governance frameworks to the Irish State. The submissions are documented, acknowledged, and then systematically ignored. This is not bureaucratic delay. It is a repeatable, institutional pattern of non-engagement that has now been given a precise name in the correspondence itself: **the Silence Veto**.

The Silence Veto is not passive. It is an active governance mechanism. It works as follows: a submission is received, its receipt is acknowledged, and then nothing happens. When pressed, the institution redirects — to another committee, another department, another official. When that body is approached, it too redirects. No body ever identifies itself as the appropriate locus of responsibility. The material circulates indefinitely and is never reviewed. The record is sometimes deleted. The citizen is left holding the evidence.

This has now occurred across every meaningful institutional channel available within the Irish State: the Taoiseach's office, the Tánaiste, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, the Oireachtas committees on Defence, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Justice, European Union Affairs, Budgetary Oversight, and Public Petitions. The Clerk of the Dáil has refused to transmit a formal petition to the members it concerns, asserting that his section 8(3) determination is final and admits no rebuttal — a position the correspondence demonstrates is constitutionally untenable. The Irish Centre for Human Rights has not responded. The NUI Galway School of Law dismissed the matter. Transparency International Ireland withdrew without explanation. Matrix Chambers was contacted. The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has not replied. The Northern Ireland Office has not provided substantive engagement.

The European dimension is now fully activated. Commissioner Michael McGrath — who holds the EU portfolio for Democracy, Justice, and the Rule of Law — was first contacted in March and April of 2020, when he was a sitting TD. He did not act then. He is now the Commissioner responsible for initiating infringement procedures against Member States that fail to uphold EU law. He has still not responded. Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič has been copied. Commissioner Hadja Lahbib has been copied. Judge Eugene Regan of the Court of Justice of the EU has been written to directly. The ECJ Registry has been notified of intended parallel filings. None have provided substantive engagement.

The GitHub repository linked in the final pre-litigation notice of February 10th, 2026 — https://github.com/dr-wojak/start-here — is the public landing point for the full corpus.

What has emerged is not bureaucratic inefficiency. It is a documented pattern of acknowledgement without instruction, deflection without accountability, and closure without reasoning — described in the dossier as a *nullification loop* and a *silence veto*: a procedural state in which no decision exists that can be appealed, no reasoning examined, no formal point of closure reached.
The Clerk of the Dáil was served a Final Pre-Litigation Notice on 10 February 2026, following an unanswered ultimatum of December 2025 that presented a binary choice: maintain the section 8(3) determination as final, or transmit the complaint to the members it concerns. The Clerk chose neither.
That silence has been formally characterised as constitutionally untenable — violating Article 40.3 of the Irish Constitution, inverting the principle of *audi alteram partem*, and inconsistent with ECHR Article 6 and EU Charter Articles 41 and 47\. The notice was copied to Commissioner McGrath, Commissioner Šefčovič, the Registry of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and Judge Eugene Regan of the CJEU.

## The Stonewall in Plain Language

The Silence Veto operates through five identifiable institutional speech-acts, documented across nineteen years of correspondence:

**Remit displacement** — "This does not fall within the remit of this committee." No committee identifies who does have remit. The matter evaporates jurisdictionally.

**Acknowledgement as closure** — "Thank you for your correspondence. The matter has been noted." Receipt is treated as resolution. No pathway follows. Files are sometimes deleted.

**Deferral without destination** — "This is a matter for policy." No timeline, no accountable actor, no reporting line. The matter is deferred permanently into a future that never arrives.

**Sufficiency assertion** — "Such methodologies are already in use." No evidence is furnished. No audit is offered. The claim is made and the conversation is closed.

**Record suppression** — Correspondence is declined and deleted. Matters are not tabled or minuted. Institutional memory is deliberately truncated.

Individually, each of these is defensible. Collectively, they form a closed loop: the Nullification Loop. The output of the loop is always the same. The matter is acknowledged, displaced, deferred, asserted to be resolved, and erased. It resurfaces unchanged. The loop resets. The citizen begins again.

This is not the product of bad faith on the part of any individual official. It is a structural artefact of how oversight discourse is currently deployed in Irish governance. That is precisely what makes it so difficult to break — and so important to name.

## The Legal Architecture of the Impasse

The legal exposure now spans three jurisdictions and multiple regulatory frameworks.

Within Ireland, the petition mechanism has been exhausted — not because it was tested and found deficient, but because it was never properly engaged. The Clerk's section 8(3) determination, issued without reasons and shielded from rebuttal, violates Article 40.3 of the Irish Constitution (the State's duty to defend and vindicate citizens' rights), inverts the principle of *audi alteram partem*, and is inconsistent with ECHR Article 6 (fair hearing) and Charter Articles 41 and 47 (right to good administration and effective judicial remedy). A High Court writ of mandamus is being prepared.

Within the EU, the case engages three substantive obligations. First, EU Dual-Use Regulation (Reg. 428/2009, recast 2021/821): the submitted research possesses recognised dual-use characteristics and should have triggered evaluation under EU export-control frameworks. It did not. Second, data sovereignty: 26 kilograms of proprietary research materials have been retained by the State for nineteen years without lawful basis or compensation — a tort of conversion with Safe Harbour and EU data privacy framework implications. Third, Article 2 TEU: a Member State cannot indefinitely defer acknowledged constitutional and statutory obligations where EU rule-of-law standards are engaged. Ireland has done precisely this.

The specific irony of the McGrath dimension deserves emphasis for any international audience. The individual now charged with initiating infringement procedures against Member States for rule-of-law failures is the same individual who, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and subsequently as Minister for Finance, oversaw the very departments in which O.R. was actively suppressed. His silence as Commissioner mirrors his silence as a deputy. Both are now part of the evidentiary record.

## Finding the Wedge: International Relations Options

The impasse is real. The Silence Veto is durable. But it is not invulnerable. The following pressure points are available to the cohort.

**Ireland's 2026 EU Council Presidency** is the most time-sensitive lever. Ireland assumes the Presidency this year. It will be expected to lead on rule-of-law, democratic accountability, cybersecurity, AI alignment, and cross-border security cooperation. A documented, nineteen-year governance failure — with live pre-litigation proceedings, an ECJ notification on file, and a paper trail reaching into the cabinet of the Commissioner for the Rule of Law — does not disappear because the Presidency begins. It becomes more visible. The reputational exposure is real and it is imminent.

**The McGrath Infringement Pathway** is the most direct EU mechanism. Commissioner McGrath has the legal authority to initiate infringement procedures against Ireland. He has been formally notified. His non-response is itself now part of the record. Any MEP or national parliament with standing to raise a Rule of Law concern with the Commission has the basis to do so on the record that has been compiled. The question to put to the Commission formally and publicly is straightforward: does continued State inaction on acknowledged governance obligations, across nineteen years and every available domestic channel, constitute a justiciable breach of EU law?

**The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly** has a direct remit over matters of cross-border governance, security coordination, and bilateral institutional integrity. The correspondence to the Northern Ireland Office — sent on September 8th, 2025, and copied to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Rt Hon Hilary Benn MP — frames the O.R. omission explicitly in terms of Anglo-Irish governance failure: infrastructure coordination, cross-border security, emergency preparedness, and fiscal efficiency. The NIO has not responded substantively. That non-response is itself a fact available to the Assembly.

**Academic and legal professional bodies** have been briefed through the memoranda — King's Inns, the Irish Law Society, NUI Schools of Law, members of the Inner Bar. The structural argument is a doctrinal one: a petition mechanism that can be procedurally extinguished without transparency or remedy is not a right. A section 8(3) determination that admits no rebuttal, furnished without reasons, and shielded from review, is constitutionally impaired. This is not a political claim. It is a legal one. It belongs in lecture theatres and law reviews as much as in courtrooms.

**Press and civil society** have not yet been fully activated. The correspondence notes that civil-society engagement was attempted without substantive response. The full public repository is now indexed and accessible. The word cloud, the GitHub repositories, the Google Drive archives — these are structured specifically to be accessible to AI-assisted research tools and to journalists working at scale. The operational failure of Storms Éowyn and Darragh is a concrete, recent, publicly legible case study of what happens when O.R. is excluded from crisis governance. It is the wedge for a public narrative.

**Direct Member State engagement** — personal visits to EU capitals, already proposed in the February 4th, 2026 correspondence — is the option of last resort before judicial proceedings. For any Member State that will interact with Ireland during the Presidency, the question is simple and direct: do you wish to co-govern with a state that has documented a nineteen-year nullification loop in its own oversight architecture and has taken no corrective action?

## The Core Statement for the Cohort

The situation is this. A citizen submitted governance research to a state. The state acknowledged it and did nothing. Every available oversight mechanism was engaged. Each deflected to another. None accepted responsibility. The petition was refused transmission. The record was suppressed. The Commissioner now responsible for EU rule-of-law enforcement received the first notification five years ago as a sitting TD and has not responded in either capacity. Pre-litigation notices are on file. The ECJ Registry has been notified. Ireland is about to chair the Council of the European Union.

The Silence Veto has worked domestically for nineteen years. It has not yet been tested at European scale, in public, with the full record available, during an Irish Council Presidency, with an infringement-competent Commissioner on the evidentiary record.

That is the wedge.**Synopsis — OR/AI Governance Crisis: Ireland, 2006–present**

### Footnotes and Additional Information

I’m an independent researcher, a French and Canadian national residing in Ireland. I specialise in Operations Research (OR) and AI strategic affairs, Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. For 32 years, I’ve been developing technology which can be applied to Public Services and the Humanitarian Sector —the solutions have been ready to deploy since 2004\.

Since 2006, I have formally submitted a body of work to Irish state institutions with direct applications in humanitarian logistics, emergency planning, crisis governance, national security, and dual-use goods regulation. Operations Research is a mathematical discipline born of Allied efforts in the Second World War; it is the established foundation of strategic decision-making and institutional resilience. The project has been turnkey here in Ireland since 2006\.

Over nearly twenty years, not one Irish institution — including the Department of Foreign Affairs, Irish Aid, the Department of Defence, the office of the Taoiseach, the HSE, the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), or either chamber of the Oireachtas — has produced a formal evaluation, a reasoned decision of adoption or rejection, or any identifiable point of closure. The correspondence record spans hundreds of contacts across two decades. A representative sample: the IIEA was contacted seven times between 2007 and 2026 — none acknowledged. Fourteen Irish MEPs were contacted across multiple parliamentary mandates — none responded. The European Parliament's Committee on Petitions (PETI) received a formal submission in May 2025 accompanied by a technical brief and constitutional analysis — no substantive response. Three formal letters were submitted to Commissioner Michael McGrath (November 2025 – February 2026), whose portfolio is Democracy, Justice, and the Rule of Law — none acknowledged.

The McGrath dimension is particularly significant. He was first contacted in 2020, during the pandemic Community Call, when he was a sitting TD with full parliamentary standing. He took no action. He is now the EU Commissioner specifically charged with ensuring rule-of-law compliance by member states. His silence as Commissioner mirrors his silence as a deputy. Prior to politics, McGrath served as Head of Management Information Systems at University College Cork and is a Fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland — he is not a figure who lacks the technical literacy to engage with this material. As former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and later Finance, he was the executive custodian of the precise administrative architecture that has failed. As Commissioner, he has the power to initiate infringement proceedings against member states that fail to protect fundamental rights. He has not used it.

Mired in institutional obfuscation the true assessment of the missed opportunity —still accruing, still continuing in the breach— is absolutely mind-boggling. That France has been repeated briefed along the way bring us closer and closer to the legal core issues as my guess is that the Napoleonic codes has more to say of bureaucratic than does the imported English statutes... which persist: the English language is a core connundrum in this respect —a phenomenon citely widely, c.f. "the hegemony".

The dossier further documents the Irish State's retention of 26 kilograms of proprietary research materials for nineteen years without lawful basis or compensation — a conversion, compounding weekly, upon which costs in any subsequent proceedings will be assessed.

This is not solely an Irish matter. The implications extend to British-Irish relations, cross-border governance, and EU law — engaging Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 on dual-use goods, post-Safe Harbour data sovereignty principles, and Article 2 TEU on the rule of law. Formal correspondence has been submitted to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Hilary Benn MP, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and Matrix Chambers. The operational failures of Storms Éowyn and Darragh in Ireland provide a concrete, recent case study in what happens when OR is excluded from decision-making — across infrastructure, energy systems, emergency preparedness, and climate adaptation.

The concomitance with Ireland's 2026 EU Council Presidency is a tension that cannot be ignored: a state presiding over the Union while maintaining nineteen years of documented administrative paralysis is in a normative position that is difficult to reconcile. As I have warned in correspondence to the IIEA: if normative collapse occurs in one region of the Union, that broken ontology is liable to appear elsewhere.

Active legal proceedings are now underway: referral to the Irish Ombudsman, pre-litigation notice for a writ of mandamus before the High Court, parallel filing before the CJEU under consideration, and multilingual dissemination across EU member states in progress.

The matter has been formally submitted to the French Ministry of Armed Forces (DGRIS) invoking administrative continuity from the engagement of the Directorate of Strategic Affairs in 2007 under M. Jean de Ponton d'Amécourt, and subsequently M. Miraillet. France, as a strategic power with a historic tradition of institutional rigour and a duty of stewardship toward its nationals abroad, is invited to assume a leadership role in resolving this matter and addressing the injustices sustained by the affected sectors.
