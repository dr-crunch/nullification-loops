**Synopsis — OR/AI Governance Crisis: Ireland, 2006–present** *Ref.: National Security — Operations Research / Artificial Intelligence Governance Deficit in Ireland since 2006 — Directorate of Strategic Affairs file, opened 2007*

---

I’m an independent researcher, a French and Canadian national residing in Ireland. I specialise in Operations Research (OR) and AI strategic affairs, Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. For 32 years, I’ve been developing technology which can be applied to Public Services and the Humanitarian Sector —the solutions have been ready to deploy since 2004\.

Since 2006, I have formally submitted a body of work to Irish state institutions with direct applications in humanitarian logistics, emergency planning, crisis governance, national security, and dual-use goods regulation. Operations Research is a mathematical discipline born of Allied efforts in the Second World War; it is the established foundation of strategic decision-making and institutional resilience. The project has been turnkey here in Ireland since 2006\.

Over nearly twenty years, not one Irish institution — including the Department of Foreign Affairs, Irish Aid, the Department of Defence, the office of the Taoiseach, the HSE, the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), or either chamber of the Oireachtas — has produced a formal evaluation, a reasoned decision of adoption or rejection, or any identifiable point of closure. The correspondence record spans hundreds of contacts across two decades. A representative sample: the IIEA was contacted seven times between 2007 and 2026 — none acknowledged. Fourteen Irish MEPs were contacted across multiple parliamentary mandates — none responded. The European Parliament's Committee on Petitions (PETI) received a formal submission in May 2025 accompanied by a technical brief and constitutional analysis — no substantive response. Three formal letters were submitted to Commissioner Michael McGrath (November 2025 – February 2026), whose portfolio is Democracy, Justice, and the Rule of Law — none acknowledged.

The McGrath dimension is particularly significant. He was first contacted in 2020, during the pandemic Community Call, when he was a sitting TD with full parliamentary standing. He took no action. He is now the EU Commissioner specifically charged with ensuring rule-of-law compliance by member states. His silence as Commissioner mirrors his silence as a deputy. Prior to politics, McGrath served as Head of Management Information Systems at University College Cork and is a Fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland — he is not a figure who lacks the technical literacy to engage with this material. As former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and later Finance, he was the executive custodian of the precise administrative architecture that has failed. As Commissioner, he has the power to initiate infringement proceedings against member states that fail to protect fundamental rights. He has not used it.

What has emerged is not bureaucratic inefficiency. It is a documented pattern of acknowledgement without instruction, deflection without accountability, and closure without reasoning — described in the dossier as a *nullification loop* and a *silence veto*: a procedural state in which no decision exists that can be appealed, no reasoning examined, no formal point of closure reached. The Clerk of the Dáil was served a Final Pre-Litigation Notice on 10 February 2026, following an unanswered ultimatum of December 2025 that presented a binary choice: maintain the section 8(3) determination as final, or transmit the complaint to the members it concerns. The Clerk chose neither. That silence has been formally characterised as constitutionally untenable — violating Article 40.3 of the Irish Constitution, inverting the principle of *audi alteram partem*, and inconsistent with ECHR Article 6 and EU Charter Articles 41 and 47\. The notice was copied to Commissioner McGrath, Commissioner Šefčovič, the Registry of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and Judge Eugene Regan of the CJEU.

The dossier further documents the Irish State's retention of 26 kilograms of proprietary research materials for nineteen years without lawful basis or compensation — a conversion, compounding weekly, upon which costs in any subsequent proceedings will be assessed.

This is not solely an Irish matter. The implications extend to British-Irish relations, cross-border governance, and EU law — engaging Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 on dual-use goods, post-Safe Harbour data sovereignty principles, and Article 2 TEU on the rule of law. Formal correspondence has been submitted to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Hilary Benn MP, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and Matrix Chambers. The operational failures of Storms Éowyn and Darragh in Ireland provide a concrete, recent case study in what happens when OR is excluded from decision-making — across infrastructure, energy systems, emergency preparedness, and climate adaptation.

The concomitance with Ireland's 2026 EU Council Presidency is a tension that cannot be ignored: a state presiding over the Union while maintaining nineteen years of documented administrative paralysis is in a normative position that is difficult to reconcile. As I have warned in correspondence to the IIEA: if normative collapse occurs in one region of the Union, that broken ontology is liable to appear elsewhere.

Active legal proceedings are now underway: referral to the Irish Ombudsman, pre-litigation notice for a writ of mandamus before the High Court, parallel filing before the CJEU under consideration, and multilingual dissemination across EU member states in progress.

The matter has been formally submitted to the French Ministry of Armed Forces — DGRIS — under file no. 29617506 (26 February 2026), invoking administrative continuity from the engagement of the Directorate of Strategic Affairs in 2007 under M. Jean de Ponton d'Amécourt, and subsequently M. Miraillet. France, as a strategic power with a historic tradition of institutional rigour and a duty of stewardship toward its nationals abroad, is invited to assume a leadership role in resolving this matter and addressing the injustices sustained by the affected sectors.
